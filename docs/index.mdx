# Global Pricing & Tax Estimator API

The **Global Pricing & Tax Estimator API** localizes prices across borders by combining:

- FX conversion to destination currency  
- Country-level VAT / GST / Sales Tax heuristics  
- Category-aware rules (digital vs physical, ebooks, groceries, etc.)  
- Optional psychological pricing strategies (.99, rounding to 0.05)

It is optimized for:

- Product teams that need **fast, deterministic localized prices**
- Developers building **global checkout flows**
- SaaS and marketplaces that want **“good enough” tax + FX** without a full tax engine

> ⚠️ This API is for **estimation and UX purposes only**.  
> It is not a tax filing or legal-compliance engine.

## What This API Does Well

- Gives you a **reasonable localized price** for a given country and product category.
- Handles **FX conversion + tax estimation** in a single call.
- Returns a **complete price breakdown**:
  - `netPrice`
  - `convertedNetPrice`
  - `taxAmount`
  - `grossPrice`
  - `displayPrice`
  - `taxBreakdown[]`
  - `meta` (confidence, FX source, rules version, etc.)

---

## High-Level Flow

1. You send:

   - `basePrice` + `baseCurrency`  
   - `originCountry` + `destinationCountry`  
   - `productCategory`  
   - Optional `pricingStrategy`  

2. The engine:

   - Converts to destination currency using cached FX rates.  
   - Looks up a country tax profile and category rules.  
   - Computes an estimated tax and gross price.  
   - Applies a psychological pricing strategy (if requested).

3. You get:

   - A localized `displayPrice` in the destination currency.  
   - A breakdown of what was applied.  
   - Metadata describing how confident the estimate is.

## Example – One Line Estimate

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_HOST>/v1/price/estimate" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Key: <YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "basePrice": 20,
    "baseCurrency": "USD",
    "originCountry": "US",
    "destinationCountry": "DE",
    "productCategory": "digital_service",
    "customerType": "consumer",
    "pricingStrategy": "charm_99"
  }'
```

Response (simplified):

```json
{
  "netPrice": 20,
  "convertedNetPrice": 18.47,
  "taxAmount": 3.51,
  "grossPrice": 21.98,
  "displayPrice": 21.99,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "taxBreakdown": [
    { "type": "VAT", "jurisdiction": "DE", "rate": 0.19, "amount": 3.51 }
