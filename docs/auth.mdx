# Authentication

Authentication is handled by **RapidAPI** via headers.

---

## RapidAPI Headers

All requests must include:

```text
X-RapidAPI-Key: <YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY>
X-RapidAPI-Host: <YOUR_RAPIDAPI_HOST>
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_HOST>/v1/price/estimate" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Key: <YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY>" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Host: <YOUR_RAPIDAPI_HOST>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

---

## Direct (Non-RapidAPI) Usage

If you are using a **direct deployment** (e.g. Railway) outside of RapidAPI, the service may also accept a private key in a header such as:

```text
x-api-key: <YOUR_DIRECT_SERVICE_KEY>
```

This is **optional** and used only for private/internal integrations. For most users, RapidAPI headers are sufficient.

## Security Guidelines

- Never hard-code your RapidAPI key in frontend code.  
- Store keys in environment variables or secret managers.  
- Rotate keys periodically if you suspect exposure.
