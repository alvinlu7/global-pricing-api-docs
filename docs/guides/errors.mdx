## Rate Limiting

Rate limits are enforced by:

1. **RapidAPI plan quotas**, based on your subscription.  
2. Optional **internal safety limits** per key.

If you receive `RATE_LIMITED`:

- Implement exponential backoff.  
- Cache successful responses.  
- Consider upgrading your plan for higher throughput.
