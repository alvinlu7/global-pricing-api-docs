# Best Practices

A few practical guidelines for using the Global Pricing & Tax Estimator API effectively.

---

## Cache Strategically

- Cache responses per `(destinationCountry, productCategory, baseCurrency)` whenever possible.
- For static price tables, refreshing once per day is often enough.
- Use [GET /v1/meta/fx](../endpoints/meta-fx.mdx) to decide when to invalidate FX-sensitive caches.

---

## Use `displayPrice` for UI

The engine already applies rounding and pricing strategies. Prefer:

- `displayPrice` for user-facing prices.
- `grossPrice` for internal calculations or comparisons.

---

## Distinguish “Beta” Markets

For countries with `supportLevel: "beta"`:

- Consider adding a small “≈ estimated” tag in your UI.
- Avoid making legal or tax commitments based purely on these values.
- Treat them as guidance for pricing and UX, not compliance.

---

## Log `rulesVersion` and `fxAsOf`

From the `meta` object:

- `rulesVersion` – which tax rule snapshot was used.
- `fxAsOf` – timestamp of the FX snapshot (if included by the implementation).

Logging these per request can be invaluable when debugging pricing anomalies later.

---

## Fail Gracefully

If:

- FX is unavailable, or  
- A country is unsupported  

…your app should:

- Either show base currency prices, or  
- Clearly surface that the localized price is temporarily unavailable.

Do not block the entire purchase experience because the estimator is unavailable.
