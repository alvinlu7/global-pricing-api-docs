# FAQ

### Is this a tax engine?

No. It is an **estimation engine** designed for UX, experimentation, and high-level pricing logic.  
It is **not** suitable for tax filing, legal compliance, or remittance processes.

---

### How accurate are the tax rates?

For `supportLevel: "full"` countries, rates are aligned with public VAT/GST/Sales Tax references and reviewed periodically.  
For `simplified` and `beta` countries, the numbers are blended approximations suitable for price localization, not for official filings.

---

### How often are FX rates updated?

FX rates are fetched periodically (e.g. daily) from a public FX provider and cached.  
Use [GET /v1/meta/fx](../endpoints/meta-fx.mdx) to see the latest `asOf` timestamp.

---

### Can I use this to file taxes?

No. You should use a certified tax provider and/or professional for any filing or legal obligations.  
This API is only meant to produce **reasonable localized prices** for global customers.

---

### Can I call the API directly without RapidAPI?

Yes, if you are given a direct endpoint and key by the maintainer (for private or high-volume integrations).  
For most users, the recommended path is via RapidAPI.

---

### I need another country added. What do I do?

Open an issue or contact the maintainer with:

- Desired country  
- Main product categories  
- Expected volume / use case  

The tax profile can then be prioritized and added in a future rules version.
