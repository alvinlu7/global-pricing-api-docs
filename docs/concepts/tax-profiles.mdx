# Tax Profiles

Tax profiles model **country-level** tax behavior for price estimation.

Each profile includes:

- `country` – ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code  
- `name` – human-readable name  
- `currency` – primary currency  
- `taxType` – e.g. `VAT`, `GST`, `SalesTax`  
- `standardRate` – standard consumer rate  
- `reducedRates` – category-specific rates (e.g. `food_grocery`, `ebook`)  
- `supportLevel` – `full`, `simplified`, or `beta`  
- `metadata` – source URL, last verification date, notes

## Example: Germany (DE)

```json
{
  "country": "DE",
  "name": "Germany",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "taxType": "VAT",
  "supportLevel": "full",
  "standardRate": 0.19,
  "reducedRates": {
    "food_grocery": 0.07,
    "ebook": 0.07
  },
  "metadata": {
    "lastVerified": "2025-11-28",
    "notes": [
      "Standard VAT rate 19%; reduced 7% for many foods and e-publications.",
      "Simplified for estimator; not a legal tax engine."
    ]
  }
}
```

## Support Levels

- `full` – regime is relatively simple; mapping is confident.  
- `simplified` – known multiple rates; estimator uses one heuristic per category.  
- `beta` – complex jurisdiction (e.g. Brazil, India) with blended approximations.  

Your app can use this to decide how prominently to surface “approximate” labels.

## Accuracy Philosophy

The goal is:

> “Reasonable localized prices for UX and experimentation, not legal tax computation.”

If you need filing-grade determinism, use a tax provider built for that purpose.

This API focuses on:

- Being **predictable**, not perfectly exact.  
- Keeping **rules versioned and transparent**.  
- Making **tradeoffs explicit** via `supportLevel` and `confidence`.
